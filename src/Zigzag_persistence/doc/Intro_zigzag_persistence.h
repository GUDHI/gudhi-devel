 * \section zigzagintro Zigzag Persistence
 *
 * We refer to the introduction page \ref persistent_cohomology for persistent (co)homology for an introduction
 * to the topic.
 * Zigzag persistence is a generalization of the latter. While standard persistence only allows to grow the filtered
 * complex by adding cells, zigzag persistence also allows removals. Hence the name "zigzag", as the module
 * diagram will have arrows alternating between forward and backward.
 *
 * The module consists of the @ref Zigzag_persistence class and two wrappers @ref Filtered_zigzag_persistence and
 * @ref Filtered_zigzag_persistence_with_storage "":
 * - @ref Zigzag_persistence computes the persistence of a sequence of insertions and removals. A cell can be inserted
 * or removed one at a time and the returned persistence pairs / bars are indexed on the operation numbers.
 * For example, if a cycle is born at operation number 6 and dies at operation number 7, it will output a bar starting
 * at 6 and ending at 7.
 * - @ref Filtered_zigzag_persistence and @ref Filtered_zigzag_persistence_with_storage are adding the notion of
 * "filtration value" to @ref Zigzag_persistence. At each call, an operation can be associated to a filtration value,
 * which will be used to index the returned bars instead (bars with new length 0 are then ignored). The two classes
 * also have more flexible inputs (the boundaries do not have to be ordered, nor identified continuously
 * from 0). The difference between both classes is on the way they manage the memory: @ref Filtered_zigzag_persistence
 * removes systematically all unnecessary information and outputs a pair as soon it is closed, while
 * @ref Filtered_zigzag_persistence_with_storage will store all informations about filtration values and bars until the
 * end and output the pairs only when asked. Depending on the use and the length of the filtration, one will be more
 * efficient than the other and vice versa.
 *
 * The implementation is based on the algorithm introduced in \cite zigzag.
 *
 * \subsection zigzaginterface Stream-like interface
 * 
 * As removals are possible in zigzag filtration, the maximal size of the complex does not depend on the length of the 
 * filtration anymore. This makes it possible to build very long fine tuned filtrations with relatively small complexes
 * which can be processed without overreaching memory space. For this purpose, it is possible to feed the module with
 * information about the filtration "on the fly" to avoid loading the whole filtration at once. Information about the
 * current barcode can be retrieved between any steps via callback methods.
