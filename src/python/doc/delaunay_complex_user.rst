:class:`~gudhi.DelaunayComplex` is constructing a :doc:`SimplexTree <simplex_tree_ref>` using
`Delaunay Triangulation  <http://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation/index.html#Chapter_Triangulations>`_
:cite:`cgal:hdj-t-19b` from the `Computational Geometry Algorithms Library <http://www.cgal.org/>`_
:cite:`cgal:eb-19b`.

The Delaunay complex (all filtration values are set to `NaN`) is available by passing :code:`filtrations = None`
(default value) to :func:`~gudhi.DelaunayComplex.create_simplex_tree`.

When :paramref:`~gudhi.DelaunayComplex.create_simplex_tree.filtrations` is:

* `'alpha'`              - The filtration value of each simplex is computed as an :class:`~gudhi.AlphaComplex`
* `'cech'`               - The filtration value of each simplex is computed as a :class:`~gudhi.DelaunayCechComplex`

Remarks about the :class:`~gudhi.AlphaComplex` and the :class:`~gudhi.DelaunayCechComplex`
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These remarks apply to the :class:`~gudhi.AlphaComplex` and to the :class:`~gudhi.DelaunayCechComplex` that we will
call *'complex'* in the following text.

* When a complex is constructed with an infinite value of :math:`\alpha^2`, the complex is a Delaunay complex (with
  special filtration values).
* For people only interested in the topology of the complex (for instance persistence), notice the complex is
  equivalent to the `Čech complex <https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/group__cech__complex.html>`_ and much smaller if
  you do not bound the radii. `Čech complex <https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/group__cech__complex.html>`_ can still
  make sense in higher dimension precisely because you can bound the radii.
* Using the default :code:`precision = 'safe'` makes the construction safe, but, the filtration values are only
  guaranteed to have a small multiplicative error compared to the exact value, see
  :func:`~gudhi.DelaunayComplex.set_float_relative_precision` to modify the precision.
  A drawback, when computing persistence, is that an empty exact interval [10^12,10^12] may become a
  non-empty approximate interval [10^12,10^12+10^6].
  If you pass :code:`precision = 'exact'` to the complex constructor, the filtration values are the exact
  ones converted to float. This can be very slow.
  Using :code:`precision = 'fast'` makes the computations slightly faster, and the combinatorics are still exact, but
  the filtration values can exceptionally be arbitrarily bad. In all cases, we still guarantee that the
  output is a valid filtration (faces have a filtration value no larger than their cofaces).

:class:`~gudhi.DelaunayCechComplex` is a bit faster than :class:`~gudhi.AlphaComplex`, but only
:class:`~gudhi.AlphaComplex` has a weighted version.

Example from points
-------------------

This example builds the Delaunay Čech complex from the given points:

.. testcode::

    from gudhi import DelaunayCechComplex
    points=[[1, 1], [7, 0], [4, 6], [9, 6], [0, 14], [2, 19], [9, 17]]
    cpx = DelaunayCechComplex(points=points)

    stree = cpx.create_simplex_tree()
    print('Complex is of dimension ', stree.dimension(), ' - ',
      stree.num_simplices(), ' simplices - ', stree.num_vertices(), ' vertices.')

    fmt = '%s -> %.2f'
    for filtered_value in stree.get_filtration():
        print(fmt % tuple(filtered_value))


The output is:

.. testoutput::

   Complex is of dimension  2  -  25  simplices -  7  vertices.
   [0] -> 0.00
   [1] -> 0.00
   [2] -> 0.00
   [3] -> 0.00
   [4] -> 0.00
   [5] -> 0.00
   [6] -> 0.00
   [2, 3] -> 6.25
   [4, 5] -> 7.25
   [0, 2] -> 8.50
   [0, 1] -> 9.25
   [1, 3] -> 10.00
   [1, 2] -> 11.25
   [1, 2, 3] -> 12.50
   [0, 1, 2] -> 13.00
   [5, 6] -> 13.25
   [2, 4] -> 20.00
   [4, 6] -> 22.50
   [4, 5, 6] -> 22.50
   [3, 6] -> 30.25
   [2, 6] -> 36.50
   [2, 3, 6] -> 36.50
   [2, 4, 6] -> 37.24
   [0, 4] -> 42.50
   [0, 2, 4] -> 42.50

**Note:** The Delaunay Čech complex can be easily replaced by the :math:`\alpha`-complex, but note that the resulting
filtration values will be different.

Weighted version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A weighted version for :math:`\alpha`-complex is available. It is like a usual :math:`\alpha`-complex, but based on a
`CGAL regular triangulation <https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Triangulation/index.html#TriangulationSecRT>`_.

This example builds the weighted :math:`\alpha`-complex of a small molecule, where atoms have different sizes.
It is taken from
`CGAL 3d weighted alpha shapes <https://doc.cgal.org/latest/Alpha_shapes_3/index.html#AlphaShape_3DExampleforWeightedAlphaShapes>`_.

Then, it is asked to display information about the :math:`\alpha`-complex.

.. testcode::

    from gudhi import AlphaComplex
    wgt_ac = AlphaComplex(points=[[ 1., -1., -1.],
                                  [-1.,  1., -1.],
                                  [-1., -1.,  1.],
                                  [ 1.,  1.,  1.],
                                  [ 2.,  2.,  2.]],
                          weights = [4., 4., 4., 4., 1.])

    stree = wgt_ac.create_simplex_tree()
    print('Weighted alpha complex is of dimension ', stree.dimension(), ' - ',
          stree.num_simplices(), ' simplices - ', stree.num_vertices(), ' vertices.')
    fmt = '%s -> %.2f'
    for simplex in stree.get_simplices():
        print(fmt % tuple(simplex))

The output is:

.. testoutput::

   Weighted alpha complex is of dimension  3  -  29  simplices -  5  vertices.

   [0, 1, 2] -> -1.33

   [1] -> -4.00
