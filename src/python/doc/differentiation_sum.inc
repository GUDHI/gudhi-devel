We provide TensorFlow 2 models that can handle automatic differentiation for the computation of persistence diagrams from complexes available in the Gudhi library.
This includes simplex trees, cubical complexes and Vietoris-Rips complexes. Detailed example on how to use these layers in practice are available
in the following `notebook <https://github.com/GUDHI/TDA-tutorial/blob/master/tutorials/Tuto-GUDHI-optimization.ipynb>`_. Note that even if TensorFlow GPU is enabled, all
internal computations using Gudhi will be done on CPU.
