    Class to generate a weighted Rips complex from a distance matrix and weights on vertices, 
    in the way described in :cite:`dtmfiltrations` with `p=1`. The filtration value of vertex `i` is `2*weights[i]`,
    and the filtration value of edge `ij` is `distance_matrix[i][j]+weights[i]+weights[j]`,
    or the maximum of the filtrations of its extremities, whichever is largest.
    Remark that all the filtration values are doubled compared to the definition in the paper 
    for consistency with RipsComplex.
