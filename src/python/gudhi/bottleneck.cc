    Compute the Bottleneck distance between two diagrams.
    Points at infinity and on the diagonal are supported.

    :param diagram_1: The first diagram.
    :type diagram_1: numpy array of shape (m,2)
    :param diagram_2: The second diagram.
    :type diagram_2: numpy array of shape (n,2)
    :param e: If `e` is 0, this uses an expensive algorithm to compute the
        exact distance.
        If `e` is not 0, it asks for an additive `e`-approximation, and
        currently also allows a small multiplicative error (the last 2 or 3
        bits of the mantissa may be wrong). This version of the algorithm takes
        advantage of the limited precision of `double` and is usually a lot
        faster to compute, whatever the value of `e`.
        Thus, by default (`e=None`), `e` is the smallest positive double.
