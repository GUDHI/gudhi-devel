    :param pdiagset: a list of ``numpy.array`` of shape `(n x 2)` (`n` can variate), encoding a set of persistence
        diagrams with only finite coordinates.
    :param init: The initial value for barycenter estimate.
        If ``None``, init is made on a random diagram from the dataset.
        Otherwise, it can be an ``int`` (then initialization is made on ``pdiagset[init]``)
        or a `(n x 2)` ``numpy.array`` encoding a persistence diagram with `n` points.

    :param verbose: if ``True``, returns additional information about the barycenter.
    :type verbose: boolean
    :returns: If not verbose (default), a ``numpy.array`` encoding the barycenter estimate of pdiagset
        (local minimum of the energy function).
        If ``pdiagset`` is empty, returns ``None``.
        If verbose, returns a couple ``(Y, log)`` where ``Y`` is the barycenter estimate,
        and ``log`` is a ``dict`` that contains additional information:

        - `"groupings"`, a list of list of pairs ``(i,j)``. Namely, ``G[k] = [...(i, j)...]``, where ``(i,j)`` indicates that `pdiagset[k][i]`` is matched to ``Y[j]`` if ``i = -1`` or ``j = -1``, it means they represent the diagonal.

        - `"energy"`, ``float`` representing the Frechet energy value obtained. It is the mean of squared distances of observations to the output.

        - `"nb_iter"`, ``int`` number of iterations performed before convergence of the algorithm.
