/**
 * \brief The concept Topological_data_with_distances describes the requirements
 * for a type to implement a container that allows computations of distance to another contained of that type.
 * \details
 * The second parameter of the distance function allow to declare power of a distance. The exact meaning of that
 * number will be different for different distances. A few examples are given below:
 * In case of p-Wasserstein distance, the power is equal to p. power = std::limit<double>::max() for bottleneck
 * distance.
 *
 * In case of L^p landscape distance, the power is equal to p. s
