/** \brief Value type for a filtration function on a cell complex.
 *
 * Needs to implement `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::has_infinity` and when it returns `true`,
 * has to implement `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::infinity()`. If it returns `false`, has to
 * implement `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::max()` instead.
 *
 * A <EM>filtration</EM> of a cell complex (see FilteredComplex) is
 * a function \f$f:\mathbf{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\f$ satisfying \f$f(\tau)\leq
 * f(\sigma)\f$ whenever \f$\tau \subseteq \sigma\f$. Ordering the simplices
 * by increasing filtration values (breaking ties so as a simplex appears after
 * its subsimplices of same filtration value) provides an indexing scheme
 * (see IndexingTag).
