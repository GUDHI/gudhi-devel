/** \brief Value type for a filtration function on a cell complex.
 *
 * Needs to implement `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::has_infinity`,
 * `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::infinity()` and `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::max()`.
 * But when `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::has_infinity` returns `true`,
 * `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::max()` can simply throw when called, as well as,
 * `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::infinity()` if `std::numeric_limits<FiltrationValue>::has_infinity`
 * returns `false`.
 *
 * A <EM>filtration</EM> of a cell complex (see FilteredComplex) is
 * a function \f$f:\mathbf{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\f$ satisfying \f$f(\tau)\leq
 * f(\sigma)\f$ whenever \f$\tau \subseteq \sigma\f$. Ordering the simplices
 * by increasing filtration values (breaking ties so as a simplex appears after
 * its subsimplices of same filtration value) provides an indexing scheme
 * (see IndexingTag).
