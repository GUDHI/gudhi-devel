/** \brief Value type for a filtration function on a cell complex.
  *
  * A <EM>filtration</EM> of a cell complex (see FilteredComplex) is
  * a function \f$f:\mathbf{K} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}\f$ satisfying \f$f(\tau)\leq 
  * f(\sigma)\f$ whenever \f$\tau \subseteq \sigma\f$. Ordering the simplices 
  * by increasing filtration values (breaking ties so as a simplex appears after 
  * its subsimplices of same filtration value) provides an indexing scheme 
  * (see IndexingTag).
