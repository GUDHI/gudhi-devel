 * 
 * The Vietoris-Rips complex
 * <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietoris%E2%80%93Rips_complex">(Wikipedia)</a>
 * is an abstract simplicial complex
 * defined on a finite metric space, where each simplex corresponds to a subset
 * of points whose diameter is smaller that some given threshold.
 * Varying the threshold, we can also see the Rips complex as a filtration of
 * the \f$(n-1)-\f$dimensional simplex, where the filtration value of each
 * simplex is the diameter of the corresponding subset of points.
 *
 * This filtered complex is most often used as an approximation of the
 * Čech complex. After rescaling (Rips using the length of the edges and Čech
 * the half-length), they share the same 1-skeleton and are multiplicatively
 * 2-interleaved or better. While it is slightly bigger, it is also much
 * easier to compute.
 *
 * The number of simplices in the full Rips complex is exponential in the
 * number of vertices, it is thus usually restricted, by excluding all the
 * simplices with filtration value larger than some threshold, and keeping only
 * the dim_max-skeleton. It may also be a good idea to start by making the
 * point set sparser, for instance with
 * `Gudhi::subsampling::sparsify_point_set()`, since small clusters of points
 * have a disproportionate cost without affecting the persistence diagram much.
 *
 * In order to build this complex, the algorithm first builds the graph.
 * The filtration value of each edge is computed from a user-given distance
 * function, or directly read from the distance matrix.
 * In a second step, this graph is inserted in a simplicial complex, which then
 * gets expanded to a flag complex.
 * 
 * The input can be given as a range of points and a distance function, or as a
 * distance matrix.
 * 
 * Vertex name correspond to the index of the point in the given range (aka. the point cloud).
 *

 * 
 * On this example, as edges (4,5), (4,6) and (5,6) are in the complex, simplex (4,5,6) is added with the filtration
 * value set with \f$max(filtration(4,5), filtration(4,6), filtration(5,6))\f$.
 * And so on for simplex (0,1,2,3).
 * 
 * If the Rips_complex interfaces are not detailed enough for your need, please refer to
 * <a href="_persistent_cohomology_2rips_persistence_step_by_step_8cpp-example.html">
 * rips_persistence_step_by_step.cpp</a> example, where the constructions of the graph and
 * the Simplex_tree are more detailed.
 *
 * \section sparserips Sparse Rips complex
 *
 * Even truncated in filtration value and dimension, the Rips complex remains
 * quite large. However, it is possible to approximate it by a much smaller
 * filtered simplicial complex (linear size, with constants that depend on
 * &epsilon; and the doubling dimension of the space) that is
 * \f$(1+O(\epsilon))-\f$interleaved with it (in particular, their persistence
 * diagrams are at log-bottleneck distance at most \f$O(\epsilon)\f$).
 *
 * The sparse Rips filtration was introduced by Don Sheehy
 * \cite sheehy13linear. We are using the version described in
 * \cite buchet16efficient (except that we multiply all filtration values
 * by 2, to match the usual Rips complex), for which \cite cavanna15geometric proves a
 * \f$(1,\frac{1}{1-\epsilon})\f$-interleaving, although in practice the
 * error is usually smaller.
 * A more intuitive presentation of the idea is available in
 * \cite cavanna15geometric, and in a video \cite cavanna15visualizing.
 *
 * The interface of `Sparse_rips_complex` is similar to the one for the usual
 * `Rips_complex`, except that one has to specify the approximation factor.
 * There is an option to limit the minimum and maximum filtration values, but
 * they are not recommended: the way the approximation is done means that
 * larger filtration values are much cheaper to handle than low filtration
 * values, so the gain in ignoring the large ones is small, and
 * `Gudhi::subsampling::sparsify_point_set()` is a more efficient way of
 * ignoring small filtration values.
 *
 * Theoretical guarantees are only available for \f$\epsilon<1\f$. The
 * construction accepts larger values of &epsilon;, and the size of the complex
 * keeps decreasing, but there is no guarantee on the quality of the result.
 * Note that while the number of edges decreases when &epsilon; increases, the
 * number of higher-dimensional simplices may not be monotonous when
 * \f$\frac12\leq\epsilon\leq 1\f$.
