 *
 * Set of classes allowing addition and multiplication, as well as inverse computation, in \f$ \mathbb{F}_p \f$ fields,
 * with \f$ p \f$ some prime number, or in multi-fields as defined in \cite boissonnat:hal-00922572.
 *
 * There are two types of classes:
 * - those defining directly a field element, allowing to use them as any integer: the operators are overwritten such
 *   that the calculation is done in the field. For example, if \f$ e = 2 \f$ is an instanciation of an
 *   \f$ \mathbb{F}_3 \f$ element class, then `e + 3` returns an element instanciation of value `2`,
 * - those only defining the operators of a field or multi-field. They represent a collection of methods taking
 *   one or two integers as input and treating them as elements of the field. For example, if \f$ op \f$ is an
 *   instanciation of a \f$ \mathbb{F}_3 \f$ operator class, `op.add(2, 3)` returns `2`.
 *
 * The field operator classes all respect the @ref persistence_matrix::FieldOperators concept.
 * 
 * \subsection fieldsexamples Examples
 * 
 * Here is a list of examples using the module:
 * \li \gudhi_example_link{Persistence_field,example_field_operations.cpp} - A simple example to showcase how
 * to use the different field element and operator classes.
