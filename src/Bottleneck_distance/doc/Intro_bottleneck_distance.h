 * 
 * The bottleneck distance measures the similarity between two persistence diagrams. It is the shortest distance b for
 * which there exists a perfect matching between the points of the two diagrams (completed with all the points on the
 * diagonal in order to ignore cardinality mismatchs) such that any couple of matched points are at distance at most b.
 *
 * \image html perturb_pd.png On this picture, the red edges represent the matching. The bottleneck distance is the length of the longest edge.
 *
 * This implementation is based on ideas from "Geometry Helps in Bottleneck Matching and Related Problems"
 * \cite DBLP:journals/algorithmica/EfratIK01. Another relevant publication, although it was not used is
 * "Geometry Helps to Compare Persistence Diagrams" \cite Kerber:2017:GHC:3047249.3064175.
