\section overview Module overview

Coxeter triangulation module is designed to provide tools for constructing a piecewise-linear approximation of an \f$m\f$-dimensional smooth manifold embedded in \f$ \mathbb{R}^d \f$ using an ambient triangulation.
For a more detailed description of the module see \cite KachanovichThesis.

\section manifoldtracing Manifold tracing algorithm
The central piece of the module is the manifold tracing algorithm represented by the class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Manifold_tracing "Manifold_tracing".
The manifold tracing algorithm takes as input a manifold of some dimension \f$m\f$ embedded in \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$ represented by an intersection oracle (see Section \ref intersectionoracle "Intersection oracle"), a point on the manifold and an ambient triangulation (see Section \ref ambienttriangulations "Ambient triangulations").
The output consists of one map (or two maps in the case of manifolds with boundary) from the \f$(d-m)\f$-dimensional (and \f$(d-m+1)\f$-dimensional in the case of manifolds with boundary) simplices in the ambient triangulation that intersect the manifold to their intersection points.
From this output, it is possible to construct the cell complex of the piecewise-linear approximation of the input manifold.

There are two methods that execute the manifold tracing algorithm: the method \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Manifold_tracing::manifold_tracing_algorithm() "Manifold_tracing::manifold_tracing_algorithm(seed_points, triangulation, oracle, out_simplex_map)" for manifolds without boundary and \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Manifold_tracing::manifold_tracing_algorithm() "Manifold_tracing::manifold_tracing_algorithm(seed_points, triangulation, oracle, interior_simplex_map, boundary_simplex_map)" for manifolds with boundary.
The algorithm functions as follows.
It starts at the specified seed points and inserts a \f$(d-m)\f$-dimensional simplices nearby each seed point that intersect the manifold into the output.
Starting from this simplex, the algorithm propagates the search for other \f$(d-m)\f$-dimensional simplices that intersect the manifold by marching from a simplex to neighbouring simplices via their common cofaces.

This class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Manifold_tracing "Manifold_tracing" has one template parameter Triangulation_ which specifies the ambient triangulation which is used by the algorithm.
The template type Triangulation_ has to be a model of the concept \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::TriangulationForManifoldTracing "TriangulationForManifoldTracing".

The module also provides two static methods: \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::manifold_tracing_algorithm() "manifold_tracing_algorithm(seed_points, triangulation, oracle, out_simplex_map)" for manifolds without boundary and \ref manifold_tracing_algorithm() "manifold_tracing_algorithm(seed_points, triangulation, oracle, interior_simplex_map, boundary_simplex_map)" for manifolds with boundary.
For these static methods it is not necessary to specify any template arguments.

\section ambienttriangulations Ambient triangulations

The ambient triangulations supported by the manifold tracing algorithm have to be models of the concept \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::TriangulationForManifoldTracing "TriangulationForManifoldTracing". 
This module offers two such models: the class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Freudenthal_triangulation "Freudenthal_triangulation" and the derived class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Coxeter_triangulation "Coxeter_triangulation". 

Both these classes encode affine transformations of the so-called Freudenthal-Kuhn triangulation of \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$.
The Freudenthal-Kuhn triangulation of \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$ is defined as the simplicial subdivision of the unit cubic partition of \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$.
Each simplex is encoded using the permutahedral representation, which consists of an integer-valued vector \f$y\f$ that positions the simplex in a specific cube in the cubical partition and an ordered partition \f$\omega\f$ of the set \f$\{1,\ldots,d+1\}\f$, which positions the simplex in the simplicial subdivision of the cube.
The default constructor \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Freudenthal_triangulation::Freudenthal_triangulation(std::size_t) "Freudenthal_triangulation(d)" the Freudenthal-Kuhn triangulation of \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$.
The class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Freudenthal_triangulation "Freudenthal_triangulation" can also encode any affine transformation of the Freudenthal-Kuhn triangulation of \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$ using an invertible matrix \f$\Lambda\f$ and an offset vector \f$b\f$ that can be specified in the constructor and which can be changed using the methods change_matrix and change_offset.
The class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Coxeter_triangulation "Coxeter_triangulation" is derived from \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Freudenthal_triangulation "Freudenthal_triangulation" and its default constructor \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Coxeter_triangulation::Coxeter_triangulation(std::size_t) "Coxeter_triangulation(d)" builds a Coxeter triangulation of type \f$\tilde{A}_d\f$, which has the best simplex quality of all linear transformations of the Freudenthal-Kuhn triangulation of \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$.

\section intersectionoracle Intersection oracle

The input \f$m\f$-dimensional manifold in \f$\mathbb{R}^d\f$ needs to be given via the intersection oracle that answers the following query: given a \f$(d-m)\f$-dimensional simplex, does it intersect the manifold?
The concept \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::IntersectionOracle "IntersectionOracle" describes all requirements for an intersection oracle class to be compatible with the class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Manifold_tracing "Manifold_tracing".
This module offers one model of the concept \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::IntersectionOracle "IntersectionOracle", which is the class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Implicit_manifold_intersection_oracle "Implicit_manifold_intersection_oracle".
This class represents a manifold given as the zero-set of a specified function \f$F: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d-m}\f$.
The function \f$F\f$ is given by a class which is a model of the concept \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::FunctionForImplicitManifold "FunctionForImplicitManifold".

  The class Constant_function does not define an implicit manifold, but is useful as the domain function when defining boundaryless implicit manifolds.

  \f[ z^2 + (\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} - r)^2 - R^2 = 0. \f]
\li \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Function_chair_in_R3(a, b, k) "Function_chair_in_R3(a, b, k)" defines the ``Chair'' surface in \f$\mathbb{R}^3\f$ defined by the equation:
  \f[ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - ak^2)^2 - b((z-k)^2 - 2x^2)((z+k)^2 - 2y^2) = 0. \f]
\li \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Function_iron_in_R3() "Function_iron_in_R3()" defines the ``Iron'' surface in \f$\mathbb{R}^3\f$ defined by the equation:
  \f[ \frac{-x^6-y^6-z^6}{300} + \frac{xy^2z}{2.1} + y^2 + (z-2)^2 = 1. \f]
\li \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Function_lemniscate_revolution_in_R3(a) "Function_lemniscate_revolution_in_R3(a)" defines a revolution surface in \f$\mathbb{R}^3\f$ obtained from the lemniscate of Bernoulli defined by the equation:
  \f[ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2 - 2a^2(x^2 - y^2 - z^2) = 0. \f]
\li \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Function_whitney_umbrella_in_R3() "Function_whitney_umbrella_in_R3()" defines the Whitney umbrella surface in \f$\mathbb{R}^3\f$ defined by the equation:
  \f[ x^2 - y^2z = 0. \f]

The base function classes above can be composed or modified into new functions using the following classes and methods:

\li \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Cartesian_product "Cartesian_product(functions...)" expresses the Cartesian product \f$F_1^{-1}(0) \times \ldots \times F_k^{-1}(0)\f$ of multiple implicit manifolds as an implicit manifold.

\section cellcomplex Cell complex construction

The output of the manifold tracing algorithm can be transformed into the Hasse diagram of a cell complex that approximates the input manifold using the class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Cell_complex "Cell_complex".
The type of the cells in the Hasse diagram is \ref Gudhi::Hasse_diagram::Hasse_diagram_cell "Hasse_cell<int, double, bool>" provided by the module Hasse diagram.
The cells in the cell complex given by an object of the class \ref Gudhi::coxeter_triangulation::Cell_complex "Cell_complex" are accessed through several maps that are accessed through the following methods.
