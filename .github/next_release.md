- [Alpha complex dD](https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/class_gudhi_1_1alpha__complex_1_1_alpha__complex.html)
     - **API break:** The simplicial complex for the Alpha complex concept has been changed to
       `dimension_simplex_range` (that must returns a range of simplices of a given dimension) instead of
       `skeleton_simplex_range` (that was returning a range of simplices lower or equal to a given dimension)

- [Simplex_tree](https://gudhi.inria.fr/doc/latest/class_gudhi_1_1_simplex__tree.html)
     - A new iterator over the simplices of the simplicial complex that match a given dimension

- [Representations](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/representations.html)
     - in metrics, `BottleneckDistance` argument `epsilon` is deprecrated and renamed `e` to be consistent with `bottleneck_distance` and `pairwise_persistence_diagram_distances`

     - Pip package is now available for OSx &ge; 13.0 (was &ge; 12.0).
