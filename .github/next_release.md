     > Matrix API is in a beta version and may change in incompatible ways in the near future.
     - Matrix structure for filtered complexes with multiple functionnalities related to persistence homology, such as
     representative cycles computation or vineyards. 

- [Rips complex](https://gudhi.inria.fr/python/latest/rips_complex_sklearn_itf_ref.html)
     - Rips complex persistence scikit-learn like interface

- [Čech complex](https://gudhi.inria.fr/cechcomplex/)
     - A new utility to compute the Delaunay-Čech filtration on a Delaunay triangulation.

     - CGAL &ge; 5.1.0 is now required (was &ge; 4.11.0).
     - Eigen3 &ge; 3.3.0 is now required (was &ge; 3.1.0).

- Maintenance
     - Some bug fix for CGAL &ge; 6.0, NumPy &ge; 2.0, Scikit-learn &ge; 1.4, Matplotlib &ge; 3.6 and TensorFlow &ge; 2.16.
